# MTCCFLset
Here, we propose the ready-to-use set of features, named MTCCFLset, as a cross-corpus feature set for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER).

First, extract features with openSilme [1] using emolarge config and save its result in a file with arff format.

Then, run main.m (Matlab file) and use MTCCFLset including 173 features in "mat", "xls" or "txt" formats.
